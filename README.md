In emergency situations, time is critical. Delays in ambulance travel due to traffic congestion often result in the loss of valuable lives. This project proposes a web and app based solution to streamline the movement of ambulances by notifying nearby vehicles on the ambulance’s path to make way, thereby reducing response time and facilitating faster access to patients.
The proposed system leverages GPS and mapping technologies to calculate the shortest route from the ambulance’s current location to the patient. Once the optimal route is identified, the application sends automated SMS alerts to registered users (drivers) within a 5 km radius along that route. The message urges them to clear the road, allowing the ambulance to pass through quickly and safely.
Key features include:
	•	Real-time route calculation using mapping APIs (e.g., Google Maps API).
	•	Dynamic identification of users within a 5 km radius on the selected route.
	•	Automated SMS dispatch using an SMS gateway (e.g., Twilio or Fast2SMS).
	•	A web dashboard for ambulance drivers or hospital operators to trigger alerts with a single click.
This project demonstrates the use of geolocation, real-time data processing, and communication APIs to improve emergency response systems. In its initial stage, the project focuses solely on sending messages to nearby vehicles, with potential future integration into smart traffic systems and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.
